I do not agree with them about the two containers "aFourContainer" and "cvContainer".

I think the second container is also necessary because it may still be A4 in the future, but the content could be  ask for only half the page.
 It's just an idea of ??mine, maybe they're right
all of them had good reviews with more details, especially Zak and they really struggled, maybe too much deep.
I liked the review of Laurentiu Badea too how he illustrated in that photo , but 
I think that laurentiu bogdan made it short and to the point.
